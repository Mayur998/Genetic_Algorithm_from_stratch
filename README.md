# Genetic_Algorithm_from_stratch

 Genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA) and is used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. Here's a brief overview:

Initialization: Start with a population of randomly generated solutions (individuals).
Selection: Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the population. The fitter the solution, the higher the chance it will be selected for reproduction.
Crossover (Recombination): Combine two parents to produce one or more offspring. This mimics the genetic crossover that happens during reproduction.
Mutation: Introduce small random changes in offspring. This ensures genetic diversity and prevents premature convergence.
Replacement: Replace the old population with the new population of offspring.
Termination: Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation steps until a satisfactory solution is found or a set number of generations is reached.
